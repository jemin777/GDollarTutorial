      <h1>Welcome to  GDollar Programming Language FAQS! </h1>
      <p>


<u>4WH Questions?</u>


</p>

<br>

<p>

<u>

1) Why    GDollar  Programming  Language  is   a   standard   programming   Language
for    Research?</u> </p>



Research   professionals   basically    follow  a  prototype  and   obsucated   software.
GDollar  P.L   also   prevent  code  stealing  from  hackers. GDollar  p.L
helps  research  professionals    to  create   a   datastructures     with  in  few   minutes.
GDollar  p.L   also  helps  professionals   to  create   a  compiler   with  in  few  seconds.


<p> <br>
<u>2) What  are  the  major  advantages  of   GDollar   Programming  Language   ? </u>

</p>

GDollar  Programming  Language   is  focused   mainly   on

<li>It  is  OpenSource.
 <li>Research</ul>
 <li>Compiler  Design using  JSLASH    to   Create a  mini compiler   with  in  a  short  period  of time.</ul>
<li>Security</ul>
<li>Interactive  with  C# P.L or  C# Technology</ul>
<li>Intermediate  Encoder </ul>
<li>GDollar  Advanced  Concepts </ul> 
<li>Code  obfuscation </ul>
<li>Used  in   Software   Development </ul>
<li>It  Prevent Code Stealing.</ul>
<li>Focused  on  Protoype  software.</ul>
<li>Mainly  used  to  create  datastructures   as  fast  as  possible.</ul>

<br>

<p><u>
3) How GDollar is formed ? What are its Advantages Over Native language JAVA Programming?</u>

</p>
<br>

GDollar is formed in C++ OOPS concepts..
JAVA borrowed C++ OOPS concepts but
GDollar borrowed C++ OOPS concepts and JAVA oops and it has
Attractive syntax ; Plus in-build functions
for Program and it is responsible for creating
libraries (.dll). JAVA has attained the Programming
standards, But GDollar attains combination of C Technology
and JAVA Technology advantages.
GDollar Generates .dll files
but JAVA Generated .class files.
GDollar Has Advanced OOPS than JAVA 1.8.

4) What   are  the  Advantages of   GDollar  Programming  Language  (Version1)  :  List  Out  Briefly:</u>

</p>

<br>
<p>

<u>GDollar Advantages over JAVA and other Programming Languages</u>

</p>


1)   GDollar  Prevents  code  stealing   so  it  is   widely  used.
GDOLLAR   intermediate  code   tells   that  this   programmer  had  coded  it.

2)
A) GDollar is the combination of JAVA , C/C++, and Advanced OOPS.
b) GDollar will only accept the shortest attractive syntax.
c) GDollar also used for construction of any datastructures.
d) GDollar helps the developers to provide inheritance by not using extends
keyword
and call the class in main program when use in linux.
e) GDollar Solves diamond Problem with multiple Inheritance when used in linux.
f) It also supports friendly function, pointers , and structures.
g) GDollar support Virtual memmory and garbage collection.
h) It is efficient, fast and easy to understand, and it is a OOPS Technology.
i) GDollar is a High level language.
j) GDollar is highly portable language
k) Using GDollar you can create any datastructures as libraries and
use it in your Application program.
l) GDollar language is a structured and object programming language.
m) GDollar has OOPS concepts like JAVA.
n) GDollar have the concept of Packages,etc.
o) GDollar have the concept of constructor or destructor and had magic oops concepts.
p) It Support functions with Default Arguments
q) It Supports Exception handling
r) It Support Generic Programming
s) It have pointer and Nodes..
t) GDollar is much simpler oops concepts, which leads to faster development and less mental
overhead.
u) GDollar is almost always explicitly compiled
w) GDollar is easy to learn. GDollar was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write,
compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages.
GDollar is object-oriented. This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.
GDollar is platform-independent.
x) GDollar creates   .exe  or  .dll   files   and  it  can be  used  with   GDollar  main  program   (CWE  EDitor  )   to  create  a  complete  software.
y) GDollar will compile and run at same time where other technology can't
do
z) GDollar is mainly used in complex programming , Billing the
goods,Graphics,etc
AA) GDollar is platform independant language
BB) GDollar is an interactive Technology.
CC) GDollar  is   used  only  in  companies  and  industries.
DD)  GDollar  is used   in  compiler design  and  datastructures construction.

<u>
5)   How    is  GDollar  Professional  software is  different   from  enterprise  software? </u></p>

<br>




GDollar  Professional  software  is  a  free  version and  opensource and  it   has  limited  time  validity of  one  month.
for    every  month   software    will    be  updated   on this  Tutorial website.
This  Website   is  focused  only   for    Tutorial /Demos  /Samples    on  GDollarProgrammingLanguage.


GDollar  Enterprise  software    is  used   only   by  companies   and  IT  CLIENTS.
GDollar  Enterprise   Software   contains   more    than  [100  Datastructures  +  
GDollar  topic   focused on  chemistry  topic . +   GDollar  Enterprise/Professional  Online course.
GDollar  Enterprise   Software   is   available  with   Professionals /Enterprise  course.
Course   duration   is  upto  1 month  only.  +  GDollar   Programming
Language   certification ] .  GDollar  Enterprise  Software   is  not  opensource.
